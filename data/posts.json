    "title": "how to use next js",
    "content": "1. Project Setup:\nCreate a New Project: The primary method for starting a Next.js project is using create-next-app. Open your terminal and run:\n\n    npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app\n\nReplace my-next-app with your desired project name. This command will guide you through setting up your project, including options for TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind CSS, and the App Router.\nNavigate and Run: After installation, navigate into your new project directory and start the development server:\n\n    cd my-next-app\n    npm run dev\n\nThis will launch your Next.js application, typically accessible at http://localhost:3000.\n\n2. Routing:\nFile-System Routing (App Router):\nNext.js uses a file-system based routing system. To create a new route, you create a subfolder within the app directory and place a page.jsx (or page.tsx) file inside it. For example, app/about/page.jsx creates an /about route.\nRoot Layout:\nThe app/layout.jsx (or layout.tsx) file is the root layout and must contain the <html> and <body> tags. It defines the overall structure that wraps all your pages.\nClient-Side Navigation:\nUse the Link component from next/link for client-side routing between pages within your Next.js application. This provides a smooth, single-page application (SPA) like experience without full page reloads.\n\n3. Data Fetching:\nServer Components:\nWith the App Router, Next.js leverages Server Components by default, allowing you to fetch data directly within your components on the server.\nfetch() API:\nYou can use the native fetch() API within your Server Components to retrieve data from external APIs or databases.\n\n4. Styling:\nCSS Modules: Next.js supports CSS Modules for scoped CSS, preventing style conflicts.\nTailwind CSS: Integration with Tailwind CSS is a popular choice for utility-first styling.\nGlobal Styles: You can define global styles in a globals.css file within the app directory.\n\n\n5. Deployment:\nNext.js applications can be easily deployed to platforms like Vercel (the creators of Next.js) or other providers that support Node.js or Docker containers.\nKey Concepts:\nServer-Side Rendering (SSR):\nNext.js can pre-render pages on the server, improving initial load performance and SEO.\nStatic Site Generation (SSG):\nFor pages that don't require frequent data updates, Next.js can pre-render them at build time, generating static HTML files.\nImage Optimization:\nNext.js provides an Image component for optimized image loading and responsiveness.\nAPI Routes:\nYou can create API endpoints within your Next.js application to handle server-side logic and data interactions.\n\n",
